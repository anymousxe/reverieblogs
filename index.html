  <div class="post">
    <h2>First Entry — Let’s See Where This Goes</h2>
    <div class="date">March 12, 2016</div>
    <p>
      I’ve never been the blogging type, but here we are.  
      I’ll probably write about games, small town life, and random thoughts.  
      Nothing special. Just somewhere to keep track of my days.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="post">
    <h2>A Channel I’ve Been Watching Lately</h2>
    <div class="date">August 3, 2016</div>
    <p>
      There’s this YouTube creator named <strong>Aaron Denvil</strong> who makes long breakdowns  
      of weird horror games. Dude’s criminally underrated.  
      Might write about some of his videos here from time to time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2017 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>Aaron Posted Something Strange</h2>
    <div class="date">October 17, 2017</div>
    <p>
      Aaron’s recent video felt… off.  
      He kept mentioning some “middlemen.” Not sure if it was lore or a bit.  
      Might be nothing, but it’s been stuck in my head.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2018 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>He’s Gone.</h2>
    <div class="date">July 15, 2018</div>
    <p>
      Everyone online is talking about it.  
      Aaron Denvil vanished.  
      I don’t like that word. “Vanished.”  
      People don’t just vanish.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="post">
    <h2>Trying to Make Sense of It</h2>
    <div class="date">December 4, 2018</div>
    <p>
      I’ve been reading forums, archived tweets, anything.  
      Nothing leads anywhere.  
      Whatever happened, it wasn’t random.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2019 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>I Think Someone’s Watching the Forums</h2>
    <div class="date">May 22, 2019</div>
    <p>
      Threads about Aaron keep getting wiped.  
      Not locked — erased.  
      I posted a theory and the whole thread disappeared in under a minute.  
      A few other people messaged me saying it happened to them too.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2020 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>It Feels Bigger Than I Thought</h2>
    <div class="date">August 11, 2020</div>
    <p>
      Some accounts that used to talk about Aaron have stopped posting entirely.  
      One of them DM’d me before they went silent.  
      They said: <em>“Stop looking. You don’t know who you’re dealing with.”</em>
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2021 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>Something Isn’t Right</h2>
    <div class="date">February 9, 2021</div>
    <p>
      I keep seeing the same symbol on random sites.  
      A black triangle, an eye, and three letters: <strong>TCI</strong>.  
      No idea what it means yet.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2022 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>This Rabbit Hole Is Getting Dangerous</h2>
    <div class="date">October 3, 2022</div>
    <p>
      I’m starting to get emails from blank senders.  
      Just timestamps.  
      No subject.  
      No message.  
      I’ve blocked every address but they keep coming.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- FINAL POST 2023 -->
  <div class="post">
    <h2>I Have a Lead on Aaron.</h2>
    <div class="date">January 27, 2023</div>
    <p>
      I don’t want to say too much here.  
      But I found something.  
      Something big.  
      If this is real, everything people assumed about his disappearance is wrong.  
      I’ll follow up soon.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="post">
    <h2 style="color:#b10000;">[ NO FURTHER POSTS ]</h2>
    <div class="date">—</div>
    <p style="color:#555;">
      The Reverie Journal contains no entries after January 2023.
