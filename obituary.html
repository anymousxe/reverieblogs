  <h1>In Loving Memory</h1>
  <div class="sub">Daniel Reed Reverie · 1999–2024</div>

  <div class="section">
    Daniel R. Reverie, 25, passed away unexpectedly on <strong>March 2, 2024</strong> 
    in what authorities described as a “single-vehicle accident” outside of Red Ridge.
    Born on April 18, 1999, Daniel was known for his curiosity, his quiet humor, 
    and his dedication to documenting strange corners of internet culture.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    He maintained a small personal journal blog from 2016 to early 2023,  
    where he often wrote about online communities, missing-media rabbit holes,  
    and the work of independent creators. His writing touched many people  
    who shared his fascination with the forgotten and unexplained.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    Daniel is survived by close friends and extended family  
    who remember him as thoughtful, persistent, and endlessly inquisitive.  
    A private memorial service will be held at a later date.
  </div>
